![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This is an interesting collection of Python scripts that I keep adding to it every now and then. Enjoy and feel free to add more to it or improve it. My ultimate goal with this collection is to have a large list of fantastic small programmes that could be used as learning reference or an add-on to a fun project. Enjoy üòâ 




### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~)
* [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)



| App Name   | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Cards Game](cards-game)  | Blackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. It's great to learn about ```while```loops and functions. Clone it and play with the computer   |
| [Leap Year Python](leap-year-python)  | A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day added to keep the calendar year synchronised with the astronomical year or seasonal year.  |
| [Number Guessing Game](number-guessing-game)  | In this game the computer will randomly generate a number and wait for the user guess, if not the same, the user gets multiple tries before losing the game, but if the user gets the correct answer then it's a win  |
| [Passwords Manager](password-manager)  | A simple Python passwords generator - letters, numbers, and symbols  |
| [Ping Pong Game](ping-pong-game)  | This program uses Turtle to draw the paddles, ball and the background. Use this simple game is very interesting to understand Object Oriented Programming |
| [Prime Number](prime-number-python) | This is one of the most questions I get asked whenever there is a coding quiz. Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves. For example, the first 5 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.  |
| [Quiz Game](quiz-game) | In this application, the user gets ten questions, one at a time from a JSON file. User gets two two options, and the score gets calculated at the end and it also uses OOP  |
| [Simple Auction Logic](simple-auction-logic) | This is rather quite a basic program to get inputs and keep the loop going unless stopped, after that provide the person with the highest bid |
| [Snake Game](snake_game) | Bringing back old phone memories, this was one of the most enjoyable games out there. Nowadays, it's almost nonexistent, for that reason I coded up a simple snake game using Turtle in Python, and quite helpful to understand more about OOP  |
| [Spelling Game Hangman](spelling-game-hangman)| It's an old-school game which can help one improve words spelling and expand vocabulary. The user gets an option to enter a letter or loses a point which all recorded in the game.   |
| [Spirograh Draw](spirograph_draw) | Add your own beautiful Spiro drawing using this application, you can customise it however you want and make it your own. It's also a great fun tool   |
| [Turtle Racing Game](turtle-racing-game) | This is a must play super simple game built with `Turtle()`module. Turtles are in different colours race to reach the end of the screen.   |
| [Units Calculator](units_calculator) | I enjoyed building this simple BMI calculator and units converto. I still want to add more units and would love to see more people add to it.  |
| [Events Email Notification](auto-email-sender) | This program for busy people who tend to forget events dates or even birthdays. It will help you to schedule birthday letter to send it on a pre-scheduled date which could save time and lots of embarrassment. üôà  |
| [Sunset Reminder](sunset-reminder) | This app uses two APIs, [Open Notify](http://api.open-notify.org) and [Sunset and sunrise times API](https://api.sunrise-sunset.org) both integrate nicely in making an app that detects when it's in the space and night time then it will automatically send you an email |
|[Tkinter Quizzler](quizzler-v2) | This is an improved version of the Quiz app that built earlier and uses the console. This version using beautiful UI and fetch data from an incredibly sourceful API  |
